# Frontend Journey

This repository tracks my **frontend development learning journey**, starting with HTML mini-projects. Each project focuses on practicing **semantic HTML**, **forms**, and **basic structure**.

## HTML Mini-Projects

1. **html-project-1**  
   - First practice project  
   - Focus on headings, paragraphs, lists, and links  

2. **html-project-2**  
   - Second practice project  
   - Focus on forms and tables  

3. **html-project-3**  
   - Third practice project  
   - Combines all previous HTML concepts  

## Skills Practiced
- Semantic HTML  
- Project folder organization  
- Version control with Git and GitHub
